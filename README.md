DateTime::Format::Strptime - Parse and format strp and strf time patterns

# VERSION

version 1.67

# SYNOPSIS

    use DateTime::Format::Strptime;

    my $strp = DateTime::Format::Strptime->new(
        pattern   => '%T',
        locale    => 'en_AU',
        time_zone => 'Australia/Melbourne',
    );

    my $dt = $strp->parse_datetime('23:16:42');

    $strp->format_datetime($dt);

    # 23:16:42

    # Croak when things go wrong:
    my $strp = DateTime::Format::Strptime->new(
        pattern   => '%T',
        locale    => 'en_AU',
        time_zone => 'Australia/Melbourne',
        on_error  => 'croak',
    );

    # Do something else when things go wrong:
    my $strp = DateTime::Format::Strptime->new(
        pattern   => '%T',
        locale    => 'en_AU',
        time_zone => 'Australia/Melbourne',
        on_error  => \&phone_police,
    );

# DESCRIPTION

This module implements most of `strptime(3)`, the POSIX function that is the
reverse of `strftime(3)`, for `DateTime`. While `strftime` takes a
`DateTime` and a pattern and returns a string, `strptime` takes a string and
a pattern and returns the `DateTime` object associated.

# METHODS

This class offers the following methods.

## DateTime::Format::Strptime->new(%args)

This methods creates a new object. It accepts the following arguments:

- pattern

    This is the pattern to use for parsing. This is required.

- time\_zone

    The default time zone to use for objects returned from parsing.

- zone\_map

    Some time zone abbreviations are ambiguous (e.g. PST, EST, EDT). By default,
    the parser will die when it parses an ambiguous abbreviation. You may specify
    a `zone_map` parameter as a hashref to map zone abbreviations however you like:

        zone_map => { PST => '-0800', EST => '-0600' }

    Note that you can also override non-ambiguous mappings if you want to as well.

- locale

    The locale to use for objects returned from parsing.

- on\_error

    This can be one of `'undef'` (the string, not an `undef`), 'croak', or a
    subroutine reference.

    - 'undef'

        This is the default behavior. The module will return `undef` on errors. The
        error can be accessed using the `$object->errmsg` method. This is the
        ideal behaviour for interactive use where a user might provide an illegal
        pattern or a date that doesn't match the pattern.

    - 'croak'

        The module will croak with an error message on errors.

    - sub{...} or \\&subname

        When given a code ref, the module will call that sub on errors. The sub
        receives two parameters: the object and the error message.

        If your sub does not die, then the formatter will continue on as if
        `on_error` was `'undef'`.

## $strptime->parse\_datetime($string)

Given a string in the pattern specified in the constructor, this method
will return a new `DateTime` object.

If given a string that doesn't match the pattern, the formatter will croak or
return undef, depending on the setting of `on_error` in the constructor.

## $strptime->format\_datetime($datetime)

Given a `DateTime` object, this methods returns a string formatted in the
object's format. This method is synonymous with `DateTime`'s strftime method.

## $strptime->locale

This method returns the locale passed to the object's constructor.

## $strptime->pattern

This method returns the pattern passed to the object's constructor.

## $strptime->time\_zone

This method returns the time zone passed to the object's constructor.

## $strptime->errmsg

If the on\_error behavior of the object is 'undef', you can retrieve error
messages with this method so you can work out why things went wrong.

# EXPORTS

These subs are available as optional exports.

## strptime( $strptime\_pattern, $string )

Given a pattern and a string this function will return a new `DateTime`
object.

## strftime( $strftime\_pattern, $datetime )

Given a pattern and a `DateTime` object this function will return a
formatted string.

# STRPTIME PATTERN TOKENS

The following tokens are allowed in the pattern string for strptime
(parse\_datetime):

- %%

    The % character.

- %a or %A

    The weekday name according to the current locale, in abbreviated form or
    the full name.

- %b or %B or %h

    The month name according to the current locale, in abbreviated form or
    the full name.

- %C

    The century number (0-99).

- %d or %e

    The day of month (01-31). This will parse single digit numbers as well.

- %D

    Equivalent to %m/%d/%y. (This is the American style date, very confusing
    to non-Americans, especially since %d/%m/%y is widely used in Europe.
    The ISO 8601 standard pattern is %F.)

- %F

    Equivalent to %Y-%m-%d. (This is the ISO style date)

- %g

    The year corresponding to the ISO week number, but without the century
    (0-99).

- %G

    The 4-digit year corresponding to the ISO week number.

- %H

    The hour (00-23). This will parse single digit numbers as well.

- %I

    The hour on a 12-hour clock (1-12).

- %j

    The day number in the year (1-366).

- %m

    The month number (01-12). This will parse single digit numbers as well.

- %M

    The minute (00-59). This will parse single digit numbers as well.

- %n

    Arbitrary whitespace.

- %N

    Nanoseconds. For other sub-second values use `%[number]N`.

- %p

    The equivalent of AM or PM according to the locale in use. (See
    [DateTime::Locale](https://metacpan.org/pod/DateTime::Locale))

- %r

    Equivalent to %I:%M:%S %p.

- %R

    Equivalent to %H:%M.

- %s

    Number of seconds since the Epoch.

- %S

    The second (0-60; 60 may occur for leap seconds. See
    [DateTime::LeapSecond](https://metacpan.org/pod/DateTime::LeapSecond)).

- %t

    Arbitrary whitespace.

- %T

    Equivalent to %H:%M:%S.

- %U

    The week number with Sunday the first day of the week (0-53). The first
    Sunday of January is the first day of week 1.

- %u

    The weekday number (1-7) with Monday = 1. This is the `DateTime` standard.

- %w

    The weekday number (0-6) with Sunday = 0.

- %W

    The week number with Monday the first day of the week (0-53). The first
    Monday of January is the first day of week 1.

- %y

    The year within century (0-99). When a century is not otherwise specified
    (with a value for %C), values in the range 69-99 refer to years in the
    twentieth century (1969-1999); values in the range 00-68 refer to years in the
    twenty-first century (2000-2068).

- %Y

    A 4-digit year, including century (for example, 1991).

- %z

    An RFC-822/ISO 8601 standard time zone specification. (For example
    \+1100) \[See note below\]

- %Z

    The timezone name. (For example EST -- which is ambiguous) \[See note
    below\]

- %O

    This extended token allows the use of Olson Time Zone names to appear
    in parsed strings. **NOTE**: This pattern cannot be passed to `DateTime`'s
    `strftime()` method, but can be passed to `format_datetime()`.

# DONATIONS

If you'd like to thank me for the work I've done on this module, please
consider making a "donation" to me via PayPal. I spend a lot of free time
creating free software, and would appreciate any support you'd care to offer.

Please note that **I am not suggesting that you must do this** in order for me
to continue working on this particular software. I will continue to do so,
inasmuch as I have in the past, for as long as it interests me.

Similarly, a donation made in this way will probably not make me work on this
software much more, unless I get so many donations that I can consider working
on free software full time (let's all have a chuckle at that together).

To donate, log into PayPal and send money to autarch@urth.org, or use the
